**Deterministic context engineering toolkit for AI-assisted development.**

`ctxlab` selects, packs, budgets, sanitizes, and applies repository context for AI chat and coding workflows. Its deterministic engine follows dependencies, ranks task relevance, explains inclusion decisions, and keeps context within model-aware token budgets.

The repository is `ctxlab`; the npm package is `ctxlab`, and the primary executable is `ctxlab`.

## Why

A raw repository dump is usually too large and noisy. `ctxlab` produces a smaller, explainable context set:

- selected files and directories get high priority
- local imports are followed recursively
- reverse dependency impact is traced so consumers of changed/selected code can be included
- staged, unstaged, untracked, or branch-diff files can be prioritized with Git-aware signals
- matching `*.test.*` / `*.spec.*` files are pulled in as related evidence
- project manifests, entrypoints, config, and README files receive structural priority
- `--focus` terms increase path/content relevance
- generated, binary, symlinked, oversized, credential, and secret-like files are filtered
- files are admitted under a token budget
- every selected file carries inclusion reasons
- omitted files report whether they lost on relevance or token budget

The selection engine is deterministic and does not call a remote model.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g ctxlab
```

```bash
ctxlab --help
```

## Changelog workspace

Generate release notes from one or more local Git repositories:

```bash
ctxlab changelog --ui
ctxlab changelog --from v1.0.0 --to v1.1.0 -o CHANGELOG.md
ctxlab changelog ./api ./web --releases 3 --title "October releases" --copy
ctxlab changelog --calendar persian-fa --format json --stdout
```

The browser dashboard runs at `http://127.0.0.1:4319`. Select directories through the local service, choose unreleased changes, recent tagged releases, or a custom reference range, then preview, edit, copy, or download Markdown. Press **Ctrl+L** from the terminal explorer to open the dashboard service; it prints the local address. All Git inspection happens locally, with no model or browser-extension connection.

By default, release notes remove merge commits, version bumps, duplicate entries, and internal maintenance or tooling commits. Breaking changes remain visible. Use `--include-internal` (or the dashboard checkbox) to include internal work. Repositories without tags can generate Unreleased notes from their complete history. Empty ranges say that no user-facing changes were documented.

`--from` is excluded and `--to` is included. Reference arguments are resolved as Git commits without passing through a shell. The dashboard listens on loopback only, accepts same-origin JSON requests, and exports through the browser without writing to repositories. Stop it with Ctrl+C. Use `--port <number>` if the default port is occupied.

The package also exports `generateChangelog`, `inspectRepository`, `createChangelogServer`, and `startChangelogDashboard` for integrations. `generateChangelog` returns Markdown, project/version sections, and commit filtering counts.

## Target-aware budgets

Use a target preset when the pack will be pasted into a specific chat/model family:

```bash
ctxlab --target chatgpt --focus "architecture review" --copy
ctxlab --target claude --changed --focus "review current branch" --stdout
ctxlab --target deepseek src --focus "debug request flow" -o context.md
ctxlab --target chatbox --focus "generic chat context" --stdout
ctxlab --list-targets
```

| Target | Safe pack budget | Reference context window | Reserved headroom |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `chatgpt` | 800k | 1.05M | 250k |
| `claude` | 750k | 1M | 250k |
| `deepseek` | 550k | 1M | 450k |
| `chatbox` | 32k | unknown | conservative fallback |

These **safe pack budgets are CtxLab policy**, not provider-published input limits. They intentionally leave room for the answer, reasoning, system/tool instructions, and existing conversation history. `--budget` always overrides the preset.

The reference windows are based on current official API documentation. Consumer chat products can manage context differently, so a target preset should be treated as a safe starting point rather than a guarantee for every session.

## Smart CLI

```bash
ctxlab src/auth --focus "refresh token flow" --budget 32k --stdout
ctxlab --focus "application architecture data flow" --budget 128k -o architecture-context.md
ctxlab src/checkout src/api --focus "checkout request lifecycle" --budget 64k --copy
ctxlab src --focus "routing" --format json -o context.json
ctxlab --changed --focus "review current work" --budget 32k --stdout
ctxlab --since origin/main --focus "impact of this branch" --budget 64k -o branch-context.md
```

## Interactive mode

Run `ctxlab` without arguments. The terminal UI now opens with a target selector first, then continues into file selection. It supports search/focus text, provider-target switching, manual token-budget selection, Markdown/JSON switching, clipboard export, and safe JSON restore.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate tree and modal dialogs |
| `Enter` / `→` | Open directory or select item |
| `Space` | Toggle file / directory selection |
| `p` | Open Focus prompt modal (task-focused context packing) |
| `y` | Instant Quick-Copy context pack to clipboard |
| `t` | Switch LLM Target profile (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek) |
| `b` | Switch Token Budget threshold |
| `r` | Toggle Secret Redaction (API keys & private keys) |
| `f` | Toggle Output Format (Markdown / JSON) |
| `Esc` | Clear selection / close modal |
| `Ctrl+L` | Open the local changelog dashboard service |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit Context Lab |

## Focused Context & Task-Oriented Packing

When addressing a specific bug or feature, use `--focus` (or press `p` in the TUI). Context Lab pinpoints the exact matching roots, pulls their direct local dependencies and matching tests, and strictly omits unrelated files:

```bash
# Task-specific context pack with safe budget for Claude
ctxlab --focus "auth token rotation" --target claude --copy

# Specific subsystem with focus prioritization
ctxlab src/core --focus "token estimation" --target deepseek -o pack.md
```

## Selection model

`smart-v1` combines explicit intent, dependency proximity, reverse-dependency impact, structural importance, Git-change signals, related tests, and lexical relevance. Large repositories are scanned using metadata and bounded samples first; full file reads are deferred until a candidate is likely to fit the budget.

### Git-aware context

Use `--changed` for the files currently modified in the working tree, including untracked files. Use `--since <ref>` to prioritize files changed on the current branch relative to a Git ref.

```bash
ctxlab --changed --focus "debug checkout regression" --budget 32k --stdout
ctxlab --since origin/main --focus "review branch architecture impact" --impact-depth 2 -o review-context.md
```

By default, reverse-dependency expansion uses one impact level. Increase it with `--impact-depth <n>` when you need a wider blast-radius view, or set it to `0` to disable reverse impact expansion.

## Output contract

JSON packs use relative paths and include token estimates, scores, hashes, and inclusion reasons. Markdown packs include a selected-file table, project tree, file contents, and omitted-file summary.

## ChatGPT & LLM Bidirectional Workflow (Dump, Apply & Revert)

Easily export context to ChatGPT, Claude, or DeepSeek, and apply the chatbot's code updates directly back into your project at their exact file locations with automatic safety backups.

```bash
# 1. Export context dump with AI Assistant Instructions protocol (copied to clipboard)
ctxlab dump src/auth --focus "refresh token flow" --copy

# 2. Paste into ChatGPT / Claude / DeepSeek.
# Once the chatbot responds (using Markdown code blocks or JSON), copy its response.

# 3. Apply changes directly to your project (previews diff and creates automatic backup)
ctxlab apply

# Optional: preview proposed changes without writing files (inspects diff plan)
ctxlab apply --dry-run

# Optional: apply from a saved markdown or JSON file
ctxlab apply response.md
# or: ctxlab apply response.json
```

### Dual-Style AI Response Protocol

`ctxlab` supports both response styles interchangeably:
- **Markdown code blocks (Recommended)**: Demarcated by `## path/to/file.ext` headers and standard markdown code blocks. Zero escaping issues, syntax highlighting in chat UIs, and native 1-click copying.
- **JSON Object**: Formatted as `{ "files": { "path/to/file.ext": { "content": "..." } } }` (or direct string values).

In the interactive CLI (`ctxlab`):
- Press **`y`** to immediately copy your context pack to clipboard from the main view (or **`Ctrl+E`** for detailed build summary).
- Press **`Y`** in the main view or **`c`** in the apply view to copy the AI response to clipboard anytime.
- When you receive the chatbot's response, press **`r`** to open the **Apply AI Response** modal: it displays a live diff preview table of all files to create, update, or keep unchanged, and applies them upon `Enter` with automated safety backup!

Restore and apply safely reject absolute paths and `..` traversal, refuse symlink-parent traversal, and save safety snapshots to `.ctxlab/backups/<timestamp>/`.

## Ignore behavior

Built-in exclusions cover common generated and sensitive paths such as `node_modules`, `.git`, build output, caches, lock files, source maps, minified bundles, `.env`, `.npmrc`, SSH/AWS credential locations, private-key formats, and logs. The scanner also rejects text that looks like private-key or common token material. Project `.gitignore` and optional `.ctxlabignore` entries are also read.

## Quality

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run benchmark
npm run verify:package
npm pack --dry-run
```

Compatibility CI covers Node.js 18, 20, 22, and 24 across Linux, macOS, and Windows. The benchmark is a reproducible regression signal, not a universal performance claim.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Context packs can contain source code, so review generated output before sharing it outside the intended destination.
